        <p>
        Algorithms are fundamental to any modern technology. Often one needs to choose one out of many available correct algorithms.
        The choice usually depends on the amount of resources used by an algorithm. So there arises a need of mathematically quantifying the amount 
        of resources required by an algorithm as a function of the size (or occasionally the value) of the input. Since there does not exists
        an entity similar to a standard computer to which all measurements of computing time may refer to. So we content ourselves by expressing 
        the time taken (one of the above mentioned 'resources') to within a mutliplicative constant.</p>
        <p> 
        Under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine#:~:text=A%20random%2Daccess%20machine%20(RAM)%20is%20an%20abstract%20computational,the%20addition%20of%20indirect%20addressing.&text=%5Br%5D%20means%20%22the%20contents,of%20register%20with%20address%20r%22.">
        RAM Model of Computation </a> we assume some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, reading and
        writing a certain location in memory requires a unit amount of time of computation. And then we study asymptotically the number of such operations required 
        by an algorithm depeding on the input size. As number of such operations is always non-negative (\(\geq 0\)), we restrict our study only to non-negative numbers.

        Some Definitions:
          <ul>
            <li> The asymptotic upper bound - \(\mathcal{O}\)-notation<br> 
              For a given function \(g(n)\), we denote by \(\mathcal{O}(g(n))\) (pronounced as  "big-oh of \(g\) of \(n\)") as a set of all those 
              functions that are <em>asymptotically less than or equal</em> to \(g(n)\). 
              $$ \mathcal{O}(g(n))=\{f(n):\textit{there exist positive constants, } c \textit{ and } n_{0} \textit{ such that } 0\leq f(n) \leq cg(n) \textit{ for all } n \geq n_{0}\}.$$
             
             <li> The asymptotic lower bound - \(\Omega\)-notation<br>
              For a given function \(g(n)\), we denote by \(\Omega(g(n))\) (pronounced as  "big-omega of \(g\) of \(n\)") as a set of all those 
              functions that are <em> asymptotically greater than or equal</em> to \(g(n)\). 
              $$ \Omega(g(n))=\{f(n):\textit{there exist positive constants, } c \textit{ and } n_{0} \textit{ such that } 0\leq cg(n) \leq f(n)  \textit{ for all } n \geq n_{0}\}.$$
            
            <li> The asymptotic equivalence - \(\Theta\)-notation<br>
              For a given function \(g(n)\), we denote by \(\Theta(n)\) (pronounced as "big-theta of \(g\) of \(n\)") as a set of all those 
              functions that are <em>asymptotically equal</em> to \(g(n)\). 
              $$ \Theta(g(n))=\{f(n):\textit{there exist positive constants, } c_1,c_2 \textit{ and } n_{0} \textit{ such that } 0\leq c_{1}g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_{2}g(n) \textit{ for all } n \geq n_{0}\}.$$
        </ul>
          Observation: For a given function \(g(n)\), \(\Theta(g(n)) = \Omega(g(n)) \bigcap \mathcal{O}(g(n)).\)
